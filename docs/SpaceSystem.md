# The Space System
The space system is meant to support different special working environments as well as support multiple environments
simultaneously. All while providing mathematical constructs needed in the supported environments.
The space system should also provide the required infrastructure to translate and customize visual information from the
supported environments to the 2-Dimensional space of the screen.
