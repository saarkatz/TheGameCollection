# Rendering directly to an image
we are going to follow in the foot steps of
[tiny renderer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer)
([here](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki)) an render directly
into and image file. Later on we will build our way to a real time
rendering within a Windows OS window.

## The TGA file format
[Truevision Advanced Raster Graphics Adapter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truevision_TGA),
abbreviated TARGA or TGA for short is a relatively simple image file
format which we will use for our rendering.
