# Graphics pipeline
Adapted from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_pipeline)

The graphics pipeline is a conceptual model to describing the steps
required in rendering a scene to the screen. Most often used in the
case of converting a 3D scene to a 2D screen. \
The steps required for rendering depend on the method that is used
and their implementation may or may not depend on both the method and
the hardware.
